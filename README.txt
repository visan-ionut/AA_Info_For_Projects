You will find several projects in this git repository,
featuring various implementations and purposes. Most of
them are projects developed for university assignments
and personal projects. I have included them here to maintain
a record and also to provide assistance or inspiration for
other use cases.

Many of them do not contain the entire file system, have incomplete
parts, and include files with explanations in romanian. I have added
only the essentials for observing and analyzing the projects. For more
details, translations, or clarification, you can send me a message via
email (ionut.visan2604@gmail.com) or through the social networks
mentioned on the main profile page.
